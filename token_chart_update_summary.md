# Token Chart Update Summary

## Changes Made:

### 1. Fixed Latest Price Display (chart.dart)
- Modified `CustomWidget` to show token prices with proper formatting using `displaySmall` text style
- Price now displays as `$0.000142` format matching Bitcoin's display style
- Connected percentage change to use `BitNetPercentWidget` for consistent styling

### 2. Added Buttons for Tokens (bitcoinscreen.dart)
- Restored Send/Receive/Buy/Sell buttons for token view
- Replaced "Swap" with "Sell" button
- Send/Receive show "coming soon" message for tokens
- Buy/Sell navigate to token marketplace

### 3. Added Cryptos Section with Mock Balance
- Shows token balance using mock data (1.25M GENST, 850K HTDG)
- Displays token icon and name in the same format as Bitcoin
- Added helper function `_getMockTokenBalance()` for different tokens

### 4. Added "Go to Marketplace" Button
- Clean glass container UI with gradient background
- Shows marketplace icon and descriptive text
- Navigates to token marketplace on tap
- Positioned after the Cryptos section

## Mock Data:
- GENST: 1,250,000 tokens
- HTDG: 850,000 tokens
- Default: 1,000,000 tokens

## Navigation Flow:
- Buy button → Token marketplace
- Sell button → Token marketplace
- "Go to Marketplace" → Token marketplace screen
- Send/Receive → Show "coming soon" message

The implementation maintains visual consistency with the Bitcoin screen while providing token-specific functionality.
