### 2. Fixed Token Prices to Match Marketplace
- **GENST (Genesis Stone)**: Changed from 0.000142 to 48,350
- **HTDG (Hotdog)**: Changed from 0.000089 to 15.75
- Updated chart data to reflect realistic price ranges for each token

### 3. Updated Chart Data
- GENST chart now shows prices from 45,000 to 48,350
- HTDG chart now shows prices from 14.80 to 15.75

### 4. Fixed Price History Generation
